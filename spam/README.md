# Sales Person Alert Module (SPAM)

This module is pretty specific to the company I work for, but it's a good example of using a few hooks including building an admin page and sending mail.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to alert sales people attached to companies are alerted whenever one of their companies are used in an article.  Once an email is sent from this article, the NID is added to an array variable stored in the variables table.
